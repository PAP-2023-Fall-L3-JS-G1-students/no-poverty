                <p>I find this goal to be important because it highlights the importance of basic human needs for everyone and how often we live in our own bubble where we do not recognize the privilege and we take advantage of accessibility to clean water access, shelter, and food. Some of these resources are not being allocated to everyone based on their environment and circumstances. Acknowledging our privilege and educating ourselves on what no poverty looks like, we can advocate for others who are in need of aid and push for basic human rights to all, and not those who can afford it. </p>

                <p>I find this goal to be important because it affects the economic status of each country it affects, as well as their overall GDP and financial well being. This can affect their infrastructure and flow of imports and exports, resulting in a cycle of poverty that is difficult to break. </p>

                    <p>I find it vital in eradicating poverty as each nation/community/family deserves adequate resources towards supporting their basic needs such as food, healthcare, education, etc. and itâ€™s unfair how disproportionately such resources are scattered globally </p>
